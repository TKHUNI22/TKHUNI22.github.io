            <h1>Happy 21st Birthday!</h1>
            <p>To my beautiful girlfriend</p>
            <p>As you celebrate this day, I want you to know that I care for, appreciate you and I'm grateful to have met you. You have become one of the most significant people in my life and I am beyond grateful for how far we've come and that you're not only my girlfriend, but my best friend. You're beautiful, sweet, talented, caring and just such an amazing person! I know I don't speak for myself when I say I'm proud of the woman that you're becoming. You're such a ray of light, never stop shining and spreading it to those around you, because you're truly a blessing to us all. I hope you have a day as beautiful as your smile is and may God continue to watch over, guide and protect you all the days of your life. Happy birthday baby, wishing you more life and blessings. Cheers to 21!</p>
